# Create Google Cloud Platform VM instance and connect GC VM using SSH from Terminal

This guide walks you through creating a Virtual Machine (VM) instance in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Prerequisits:

Google account (you can use an existing one)

## Generate public- and private key

### 1. Generate keys

In your local terminal generate a public and private key with the following command below.
 
replace PATH with a secure location on your local drive where you store your keys (for example ~/.ssh/)
		replace KEYNAME with a descriptive name (for example CGPkey)
		replace USERNAME with your username in GCP 
		a strong passphrase is recommended for added security
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f PATH/KEYNAME -C USERNAME
```

## Create a VM instance

### 1 Create or Select a Project:

Creat a NEW PROJECT or use an excisting project in Google Cloud Platform (cloud.google.com)

### 2 Create VM instance

In the Navigation Menu (top left) navigate to Compute Engine > VM instances > click CREATE INSTANCE (top middel)

### 3 Configure the VM instance

Name: choose a descriptive name for your VM

Region/Zone: Select a region based on your location or target audience (affects latency). Choose a zone within the region for redundancy (availability).

Machine configuration: 
- select E2	
- select e2-standard-32gb (16gb to save costs)
- Available policies (optional):
- GCP offers Spot VMs for lower costs. However, these VMs can be interrupted if needed by GCP, but 60-90% discount

Boot disk: Operating system: select Ubuntu 20.04. Optional: Boot disk type: select Standard persistent disk to save costs. Size (GB): 500 GB and resize upwars later if needed. Downgrading size is not possible.
	
Firewall: activate allow HTTP traffic (needed for Jupyter notebook on local browser)

Click CREATE
	
This guide provides a basic configuration. You might need to adjust settings based on your specific needs.

## Upload public key to CGP

### 1 Add public SSH key

In GCP Navigation Menu navigate to Compute Engine > Metadata > SSH KEYS > EDIT > +ADD ITEM

Open your public key in your local terminal (for example with nano GCPkey.pub)

Copy this key

In GCP click ADD SSH KEY

Paste the key in SSH key 1
	click SAVE

## Use private key to connect VM with local terminal

### 1 Obtain VM External IP:

In the GCP Navigation Menu, navigate to Compute Engine > VM instances

Ensure the VM instance is active. if not, click Start/resume in the instance's menu 

Copy External IP address of the instance

### 2 Establish SSH Connection

Open a terminal in your local machine

Use the following command, replacing USERNAME with your GCP username and EXTERNALIP with the copied IP, confirm  the connection when prompted 
```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/CGPkey USERNAME@EXTERNALIP
```
	
For the next time you SSH you VM instance, this External IP will change. Remember to copy-paste it in the command.

You have now successfully established an SSH tunnel to your VM instance and can interact with it from your local terminal.


**Troubleshooting:** 

### Connection refused
Firewall: Ensure SSH port (22 by default) is open in the VM's firewall rules.

SSH service: Verify SSH service is running on the VM using sudo systemctl status sshd. If not, start it with sudo systemctl start sshd.

### Permission denied (publickey)
Key permissions: Ensure private key is readable only by you: chmod 600 ~/.ssh/CGPkey.

Authorized_keys: Verify your public key is added to the authorized_keys file on the VM (usually located at ~/.ssh/).
Connection timed out

	Network connectivity: Check your internet connection and network configuration.
	VM status: Ensure the VM is running and accessible.
