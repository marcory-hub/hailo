# How to Install Hailo SW Suite Without Required Hardware (Part 1/2)

## Create Google Cloud Platform VM Instance and Connect via SSH
This guide explains how to create a virtual environment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to install the Hailo Software Suite (SW Suite) even if you don't have the 

Part 1 focuses on setting up a virtual environment by creating a Virtual Machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and establishing a secure SSH connection to it from your local terminal. 

Once connected, you'll be able to interact with the VM as if it were a local machine and proceed with the Hailo SW suite installation in Part 2.

- Google account
- Access to [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com)

## Generate public- and private key

In your local terminal generate a public and private key with the following command below. Replace PATH with a secure location on your local drive where you store your keys (for example ~/.ssh/). Replace KEYNAME with a descriptive name (for example CGPkey). Replace USERNAME with your username in GCP, a strong passphrase is recommended for added security.
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f PATH/KEYNAME -C USERNAME
```

## Create a VM instance
This guide provides a basic configuration. You might need to adjust settings based on your specific needs.

1. **Create or Select a Project**: Creat a NEW PROJECT or use an excisting project in Google Cloud Platform (cloud.google.com)
2. **Create VM instance**: In the Navigation Menu (top left) navigate to Compute Engine > VM instances > click CREATE INSTANCE (top middel)
3. **Configure the VM instance**: 
**Name**: choose a descriptive name for your VM.

**Region/Zone**: Select a region based on your location or target audience (affects latency). Choose a zone within the region for redundancy (availability). 

**Machine configuration**: select E2, select e2-standard-32gb (16gb to save costs), available policies (optional): GCP offers Spot VMs for lower costs. However, these VMs can be interrupted if needed by GCP, but 60-90% discount. 

**Boot disk**: Operating system: select Ubuntu 20.04. Optional: Boot disk type: select Standard persistent disk to save costs. Size (GB): 500 GB and resize upwars later if needed. Downgrading size is not possible. 

**Firewall**: activate allow HTTP traffic (needed for Jupyter notebook on local browser).
5. Click CREATE

## Upload public key to CGP

1. In GCP Navigation Menu navigate to Compute Engine > Metadata > SSH KEYS > EDIT > +ADD ITEM
2. Open your public key in your local terminal (for example with nano GCPkey.pub)
3. Copy this key
4. In GCP click ADD SSH KEY
5. Paste the key in SSH key #
6. click SAVE

## Use private key to connect VM with local terminal

1. **Obtain VM External IP**: In the GCP Navigation Menu, navigate to Compute Engine > VM instances. Ensure the VM instance is active. If not, click Start/resume in the instance's menu. Copy External IP address of the instance.
2. **Establish SSH Connection**: Open a terminal in your local machine. Use the following command, replacing ~/.ssh with the path you use to store public- and private keys. Replace USERNAME with your GCP username and EXTERNALIP with the copied IP, confirm  the connection when prompted.
```sh
ssh -i ~/.ssh/CGPkey USERNAME@EXTERNALIP
```
	
For the next time you SSH you VM instance, this External IP will change. Remember to copy-paste it in the command.

## Troubleshooting 

### Connection refused
**Firewall**: Ensure SSH port (22 by default) is open in the VM's firewall rules.

**SSH service**: Verify SSH service is running on the VM using `sudo systemctl status sshd`. If not, start it with `sudo systemctl start sshd`.

### Permission denied (publickey)
**Key permissions**: Ensure private key is readable only by you: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/CGPkey` (adjust path and keyname if needed).

**Authorized_keys**: Verify your public key is added to the authorized_keys file on the VM (usually located at ~/.ssh/).

### Connection timed out
**Network connectivity**: Check your internet connection and network configuration.

**VM status**: Ensure the VM is running and accessible.
