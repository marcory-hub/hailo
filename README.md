Initial setup of a virtual environment for Hailo8L accelerator experiments. It involves creating a Virtual Machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and establishing a secure SSH connection to it. Once connected, you can interact with the VM as if it were a local machine. This provides a foundation for installing the Hailo Software Suite in the subsequent part.
