## How to Install and test Hailo SW Suite Without Required Hardware
Raspberry Pi 5 with AI-kit Hailo8L accelerator experiments for computer vision: Google Cloud Platform Setup and test transformation, parsing, and optimization with the Hailo Software Suite with a model trained on Teachable Machine.

### [Create Google Cloud Platform VM Instance and Connect via SSH](https://github.com/marcory-hub/hailo/blob/main/create-and-connect-gcp-vm-instance-w-local-terminal.md)

Initial setup of a virtual environment for Hailo8L accelerator experiments. It involves creating a Virtual Machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and establishing a secure SSH connection to it. Once connected, you can interact with the VM as if it were a local machine. This provides a foundation for installing the Hailo Software Suite in the subsequent part.


### [Install Hailo Software Suite on Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/marcory-hub/hailo/blob/main/install-hailo-software-suite-on-google-cloud-VM-instance.md)
Installing the Hailo Software Suite as a Docker file on the Google Cloud VM instance.


### [Transforming and Parsing a Tensorflow Keras file (made with Teachable Machine) with Hailo suite on GCP](https://github.com/marcory-hub/hailo/blob/main/transform-and-parse-tensorflow-keras-file.md)
Teachable Machine can be used as a quick method to create a TensorFlow .h5 file, which can then be transformed and parsed for further use. To create a Teachable Machine model, you can use your own dataset of images or download a public dataset (for example from Kaggle).
